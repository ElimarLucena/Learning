<h1 align="center">gRPC in C#</h1>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> gRPC is a modern, open-source framework for building high-performance, scalable APIs, particularly useful for service-to-service communication in distributed systems. It's built on HTTP/2 and uses Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) for efficient data serialization. gRPC enables language-agnostic communication, allowing different services to be written in various languages and still interact seamlessly.
